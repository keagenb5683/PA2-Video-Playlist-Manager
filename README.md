Description: This is a project that showcases the use of doubly linked lists to present provided data referencing popular films.
			 I have created a menu that allows users to navigate a list of options to view, edit, and shuffle the movies and their respective data.
			 Options on the menu with the "*" are either not fully incorporated, or weren't required yet for this version of the project (as it was turned in as multiple assignments in parts)
